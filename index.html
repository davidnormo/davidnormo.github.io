        <p>Apr 25, 2020</p>
        I&rsquo;ve had more time for reading this week so here is a summary of
        changes in tech/business this week. Netflix doubles expected growth
        Corvid-19 continues to change user behaviour with surge in entertainment
        services Link Amazon given £294m in tax credits Revenue increases to
        £32bn in Europe but we&rsquo;ll wait to see if that translate to profit
        given the challenging times of distribution and warehousing. This is
        particularly interesting given the new UK digital tax that came into
        effect 1 April.

        <p>Apr 14, 2020</p>
        hired.com allows those looking for jobs to complete assessments to
        improve their prospects. One of the programming problems I had to solve
        was: A flight of stairs has n steps, you are able to jump 1, 2, or 3
        steps at a time. How many different ways are you able to climb the
        stairs in different combinations of jumps? E.g. n = 3 then the answer is
        4 because: 111, 21, 12, 3

          ><h2>The Partition On Kata</h2></a
        >
        <p>Apr 3, 2020</p>
        The partition on kata is as follows: Given the fn partitionOn(predicate,
        arr) modify array so that all items in the list are re-ordered with all
        items that fail the predicate are first and all items that pass it
        follow after. The return value of the the array should be the index of
        the first item that passed the predicate. For example: const arr =
        [1,2,3,4,5] partitionOn(isEven, arr) // =&gt; 3 console.

        <p>Feb 2, 2019</p>
        <p>
          Circular or recursive dependencies are modules that eventually depend
          upon themselves. This causes unexpected errors at run time such as
          module exports seemingly being undefined.

        “What now?” may have been your first reaction. This post looks at how we
        can use advanced functional concepts to make your code more composable
        (and therefore reusable!). This is not a new concept but it’s not
        familiar to a lot of developers especially outside of the Clojure
        community, where they were invented. Transducers aren’t incomprehensible
        but they require a bit of patience and learning. TL;DR Pros: Composable
        transformation pipelines which are independent of their input and output
        sources and they perform really well.

        >
        <p>Aug 10, 2018</p>
        A little over a year ago, I helped to design a query language (similar
        to SQL) for users of a wealth management product we were building. I
        worked on the initial language design and the front end experience while
        Bruno Felix built the final version and hooked it up to our
        client&rsquo;s Java backend. The potential users of the product would
        not be DBAs, programmers or even be particularly computer savvy.

          Searls (<a href="https://twitter.com/searls">@searls</a>) gave a great
          and balanced talk about the value of mocking. Stop reading. Watch the
          talk. All of it. Or read my

        SKU - &ldquo;Stock Keeping Unit&rdquo; is the name for a single product
        that can be counted as stock. For example a medium blue shirt is a SKU
        of the blue shirt product of the Shirt category. PDP - Product Details
        Page - The page of the website dedicated to a product that provides
        customers with information and a way to purchase. PLP - Product Listing
        Page - Fundamentally a PLP allows the user to view multiple products but
        may also allow the user to change how they see them (filters and
        sorting) and link to each PDP
